# Simple Object Store Service

## Running

Clone the repo and run `npm install` then `node index.js`. Server will run on `localhost:3000`. 

Use your favorite API platform to make requests (I prefer Postman).

GET

/objects

Will respond with storage size for all objects per user in kilobyes

/users/:id/objects/:version?

Will get a given version of an object for a given user if version is specified. If version is not specified latest version will be returned.

POST

/users/:id/objects

Will post an object to a given user. If a user already has that object it will not post.

DELETE

/users/:id/objects/:version?

Will delete a given version of an object on a given user. If a version is not selected all objects for that user will be deleted.

## Implementation

I opted for a minimalist approach assuming a demo coming up with a short deadline. REST seemed appropriate for this implementation.

With more time, TypeScript would be appropriate to have type checking to help eliminate bugs. I did add some guard clauses to check input but more could be added. Objects are never validated, a framework like Joi could help here.

JavaScript does not have a native sizeof command like languages like C so I opted to pull in the "object-sizeof" package. Similarly checking if objects are equivalent is difficult in JavaScript so I used a lodash function here.

Perhaps most importantly there is no ACL so anyone can access anyone else's data. Implementing this would be a high priority.
